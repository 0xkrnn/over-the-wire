SSH :

    > Secure Shell is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate
    > used to connect two devices (server and client)
    > we can also use ssh for file transferring
    > SSH clients will typically support SCP (Secure Copy) and/or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) for transferring data
    > SSH runs on TCP/IP
    > PORT 22


Prerequisites

    > The remote computer must be turned on and have a network connection.
    > The IP address or the name of the remote machine.
    > Permission to access the remote computer.
    > Firewall settings to allow SSH connections.

How does SSH work ? 

    > A client-side component is a program used to connect to another machine.
    > SSH daemon constantly listens to a specific TCP/IP port for possible client connection requests.
    > When establishing a connection, the client provides identification data to the server (as a username/password or SSH keys).
    > The client and server exchange cryptographic keys to create a secure communication channel. The keys help encrypt subsequent communication.


Logging with SSH :

    > ssh remote_username@remote_host -p portNumber
    > To exit --> exit


Task :

    > login to the ssh server
    > read the file 
    > you will get the answer
