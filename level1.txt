Dashed filenames :

    > filename begins with dash are called dashedfile or hyphenated file
    > if we use touch -abc.txt, it will give you an error
    > because anything after -(hyphen) will be treated as an option
    > To resolve this

        $ touch -- -abc.txt		[Option #1]
        $ touch ./-abc.txt		[Option #2]


Create a Hash File in Linux :

    > touch #cat.txt
    > bash will intercept this as a comment

        $ touch ./#abc.txt
        $ touch '#abc.txt'  

    > we should wrap the filename with '' (apostrophe), if we need to create a file that starts with special character other that hyphen(-)

Solution :

    > if we list the files we can find a file named - (hyphen).
    > Read that file
